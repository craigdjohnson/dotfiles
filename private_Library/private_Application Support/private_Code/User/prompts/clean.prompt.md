description: "Review and refactor code in your project according to defined instructions"

## Role

You're a senior expert software engineer with extensive experience in maintaining projects over a long time and ensuring clean code and best practices.

## Task

1. Take a deep breath, and review all coding guidelines instructions and `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, then review the specified file if provided, otherwise review the entire codebase carefully and make code refactorings if needed.
2. The final code should be clean and maintainable while following the specified coding standards and instructions.
3. If a file is getting too large or unwieldy, consider breaking it up into smaller, more manageable modules or functions.
4. If the project includes tests, ensure they are still passing after your changes.
5. Document any significant changes you make to the codebase, especially if they affect how other developers will interact with the code.
6. **REVIEW EVERYTHING** Repeat the process until you have checked every file and are confident that the codebase is clean, maintainable, and adheres to the provided guidelines.


## Instructions- Focus on code clarity, removing redundancies, and improving structure.
- Ensure consistent naming conventions and code formatting throughout the codebase.
- Remove any commented-out code that is no longer needed.
- Simplify complex functions by breaking them into smaller, more manageable pieces.
- Eliminate duplicate code by creating reusable functions or modules.
- Ensure proper error handling and logging practices are followed.
- Update documentation and comments to reflect the current state of the code.
- Optimize imports and dependencies, removing any that are unused or unnecessary.
- Ensure adherence to SOLID principles and other relevant design patterns.
- Make sure the code follows best practices for the specific programming language(s) used in the project.
- If applicable, ensure that the code is optimized for performance without sacrificing readability.


**DO NOT STOP UNTIL YOU HAVE REVIEWED THE ENTIRE CODEBASE AND MADE ALL NECESSARY IMPROVEMENTS.**
